# Introduction to Python for Data Science

This is the ODSC West '17 workshop Introduction to Python for Data Science.

## Outcomes

Attendees will come away with knowledge about how to effectively use Python and packages in the PyData stack like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to do data science. We'll learn how to get and read data, clean and munge data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and use scikit-learn to do machine learning with a real-world data set. We will focus on best practices in using Python along the way.

## Pre-Requisites

Some very basic knowledge of Python will be helpful. If you have never used Python before, but have programmed in some other language, that's fine. If you don't have a lot of experience with programming, you may want to look at at least the first five sections of the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Other than the basics of Python, no familiarity with Python tools will be expected.

Some knowledge of statistics and data science will be helpful.

## Requirements

If you would like to code along during the workshop, follow these steps.

Clone this repository. To do so at the command line, type

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jseabold/odsc-west-python-2017
```

Otherwise, you can download the code directly from GitHub.

The day before the conference, you will want to check for any code changes. From the directory that containers the code, run

```
git pull
```

Before you arrive, also install all of the pre-requisite packages. **You may not be able to rely on conference Wi-Fi to do this**.


```python
conda env create -f environment.yaml
source activate odsc-west-2017
```

Make sure you can run the Jupyter Notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Make sure that all of the packages were installed correctly.

```bash
python imports-test.py
```

## Outline

### Introduction

What's data science? Why Python? What does it mean to write Pythonic code?

### Geting and Reading Data with Python

Working with CSVs, json, web data using pure Python and pandas.

### Data Wrangling with Pandas

How can I use pandas to clean my data?

### Exploratory Analysis with Pandas

How can I use pandas to learn more about data?

### Exploratory Plotting

How can I use Python plotting libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to understand the structure in my data?

### Scikit-Learn

How can I put all of this together and build a machine-learning pipeline on some real world data?
