fix mlxtend dependency?
add xgboost dependency
add imbalance learn dependency <----
fix openml dependency in imbalanced data -> csv interface
pca faces plot broken
fancyimpute?
create requirements file, add instructions to install using requirements file

text data too slow?

compare my outlier detection with Alex from scipy

hashing vecorizer in out-of-core
different text dataset for exercise?
consolidate outlier detection here with aml outlier detection notebook slides?

aclImdb remove unsupervised folder


exercises missing
------------------
5 out of core? Makes no sense?
extra imbalanced data
extra missing values


solutions missing
------------------
2 pipeline
3 evaluation
4 text data
extra dimensionality reduction
extra gradient boosting
extra deep learning
extra outlier detection
extra topic modelling


for next time
--------------
get rid of preamble and mglearn (maybe? maybe not?)
add deep learning with keras to deep learning
add gp back in
gp exercise impossibly hard
box-cox?
